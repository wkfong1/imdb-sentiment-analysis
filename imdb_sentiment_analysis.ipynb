       "      <td>After some internet surfing, I found the \"Homefront\" series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program \"Nightline\", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d√©cor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a \"homefront\" either. Curiously, the first episode of the show \"Homefront\" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. That's like shooting the first episode of \"Gilligan's Island\" showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil \"whites\" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. We're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for \"Homefront\". The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical \"frightened / angry black family\". The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 ¬ñ 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a hip, distant attitude could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon, never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. David Giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films, especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky \"comments\" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them senseless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent, and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit, to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters, poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them.</td>\n",

       "0  My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.<br /><br />The trailer of \"Nasaan ka man\" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role. I have never been this touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. Imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema!! Way to go, Jericho and Claudine!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1  Believe it or not, this was at one time the worst movie I had ever seen. Since that time, I have seen many more movies that are worse (how is it possible??) Therefore, to be fair, I had to give this movie a 2 out of 10. But it was a tough call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2  After some internet surfing, I found the \"Homefront\" series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program \"Nightline\", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.<br /><br />To this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d√©cor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.<br /><br />As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a \"homefront\" either. Curiously, the first episode of the show \"Homefront\" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. That's like shooting the first episode of \"Gilligan's Island\" showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil \"whites\" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. We're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for \"Homefront\". The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical \"frightened / angry black family\". The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.<br /><br />In yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.<br /><br />Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 ¬ñ 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.   \n",
       "3  One of the most unheralded great works of animation. Though it makes the most sophisticated use of the \"cut-out\" method of animation (a la \"South Park\"), the real talent behind \"Twice Upon a Time\" are the vocal characterizations, with Lorenzo Music's (Carlton from TV's \"Rhoda\") Woody Allen-ish Ralph-the-all-purpose-Animal being the centerpiece. The \"accidental nightmare\" sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4  It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a hip, distant attitude could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon, never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. David Giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.<br /><br />Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films, especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky \"comments\" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them senseless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. <br /><br />In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent, and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit, to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye. <br /><br />As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters, poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "      <td>After some internet surfing, I found the \"Homefront\" series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program \"Nightline\", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d√©cor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a \"homefront\" either. Curiously, the first episode of the show \"Homefront\" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. That's like shooting the first episode of \"Gilligan's Island\" showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil \"whites\" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. We're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for \"Homefront\". The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical \"frightened / angry black family\". The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 ¬ñ 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.</td>\n",

That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon, never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. David Giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films, especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky \"comments\" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them senseless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent, and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit, to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters, poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them.</td>\n",

The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone!

He plays Tony Montana, A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break'em for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's Brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant (\"Say goodnight to the bad guy\"). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it's a must-see. For the rest of you it's highly recommended. 10/10</td>\n",

       "      <td>Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was of course \"no question about it\" that I had to see this one. However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like \"extremely boring\" or \"nothing happened\" \"a complete waste of time\". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful, but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it. My god... I like my friends a lot but it's a pity that I can't share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. That thing, my friends, is beauty. As this film goes to show, beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced, intellectually shallow, consumer driven fast-food western societies. That doesn't mean however that I reject these fast-paced societies or that I look down on them (and neither does Kubrick) but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in. And what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we go to this place it is possible to get a so called \"natural high\". It is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty. And never in my life has this \"natural high\" or \"spiritual orgasm\" as it is called by some or \"samaddhi\" by others been more intense. Yes it's more intense than a regular orgasm... several times more intense actually. Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right. Are they right? For me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe. In my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it: \"Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter the four-million year old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery.\" The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I experience when watching those gorgeous visuals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast-food answers to big ontological questions. But instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers. The doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble, while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame. But this film shows us that when fast ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a \"thing in itself\" the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating, enchanting and maybe even comforting. We don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to let mystery be what it is, to embrace it even... we can finally bring our souls to rest. I am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed. Especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.</td>\n",

Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day.

Instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. He knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where nobody can understand him. The problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with. For me the film transports this hopelessness very well, with its dreary, artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than 'The Matrix' or 'The Thirteenth Floor' it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot, instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects.

Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like Kenneth Branagh in \"Celebrity\").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's \"Winter Light,\" the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. It all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allen's later \"serious\" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. I'll take \"Interiors.\" Woody's rarely made a funnier movie.</td>\n",

He dislikes the bland consumer-led emptiness of purgatory; a sort of 'living' but not progressing, i.e. not getting anywhere - even the city's metro trains don't stop at the stations. It has a Metro system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually board those trains. He is unable to reach fragrant, sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination.

The flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young Ann is in the wedding of her friend Lila. At the wedding she meets Harris who will impact her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more \"responsible,\" a mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all the good. The period detail in the movie is great. The dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. really put you in another time and place. And there is some very quality acting in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Lila's brother Buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then... you are supposed to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her. And I thought the whole, \"he might be gay\" thing was out of the blue and didn't serve a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we have Harris. The character acts wooden and creepy. Had this been another genre, you would have known that Harris was the serial killer from the get go. It is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so (but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the grandest problem of all. Why don't Ann and Harris get together? They fall for each other. They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and I couldn't help but wondering why. WHY? The movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so I had a hard time feeling sorry for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part of the story in the present is fairly boring. The clich√© good daughter and the clich√© bad daughter. Nina changes over the course of the movie but I am not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a \"touching\" scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old Ann dreaming she's chasing a butterfly. It is really lame and embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\"There are no mistakes\", Ann advises at us. The statement doesn't ring true with the story. And it doesn't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors.</td>\n",

Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship. \"Jacknife\" might be the quietest Vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified. Moreover, it can make us believe that the war has not finished, yet; at least for some of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three main characters are amazing.

And yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to the latter, the only major flaw is that Broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer. Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio, demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected. Indeed, given Ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same is also true of the soundtrack. Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mixes and whilst I'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the \"original\", the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior. Indeed, though the DD5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score, both are equally fine and free of technical flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries, loads of featurettes and various galleries. Indeed, given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary, there really is little to discuss. The 'Anatomy of a Stunt' featurette, for example, is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes for the rest of pieces. As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken's pre-production, production and post-production. And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of', in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the various pieces, then, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion. Then again, there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks. The one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously. Ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. And the technical ones are, well, extremely technical. Of course, we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs, but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome.

Sure, Shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with self-importance, but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so - by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe-inspiring. There are many troubling things about the play. It is a racist play about racism - and that still sticks. I have never accepted Jessica's desertion of her father without any acceptable reason. I have never accepted the Christians' position of sanctimonious self-righteousness. But, brilliantly, there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set, and mercifully, much of Jessica's part is cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text is quite stripped down with many passages cut. But, I only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when I expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all.

       "      <td>The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and \"idiot\" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama. There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (Sang, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that Park has displayed with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underrated I'm a Cyborg but That's OK, should be taken as a given. Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters, and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric, part romantic/erotic, part dramatic and lastly fantastical. And it doesn't always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set-up (though as a horror movie Park has more than his share of scary scenes). It's more akin to the movie Near Dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was, and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention, and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed. Once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds, you've seen em' all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor, much like Oldboy, only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being. An example of this can be found with the Priest's predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor. Or the manner in which Tae-Joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive, even as she's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood-suckers who've brought pain and horror to her home. But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together, of drama and existential pains, of a Bunuelian-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too), and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets. Not in a pornographic manner, but in the sense of these characters' release and escape, which doesn't last long over the scope of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's not as great as Oldboy, it's not something to carp about. Not all films Chanwook Park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and, at the least, he'll always be known as the man who directed that movie). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre, and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general. The film-making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and what a white room of 'daylight' the characters live in!), the humor is dark and hilarious, the acting is intense and moody- especially from subtle strokes from Song Kang-ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK-vin, and the ending, when it does finally get there, is one of those truly superb vampire-movie endings you'll be talking about for years, in a good way. In a battle between Thirst and Twilight, Thirst takes the knock-out in the first round. Between Let the Right One In or Near Dark, it's tougher to call. 9.5/10</td>\n",

For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 Sept-29 Dec 1949) and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain). These sets pretty much render \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\" movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice-over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started out Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to Lone Ranger status, his partnering with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the taming of his horse \"Silver\". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil. While a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an Indian was distrusted, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil. One persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value. The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: \"who was that masked man?\". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be. If you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, what do I know?

The mechanical Mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly &amp; there is no way on Earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it, actually the more I think about the more ridiculous the idea is.

The acting was poor, Wagner looks embarrassed &amp; this is probably the only thing the likes of Dien &amp; Bosley can get these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fallen Ones is a bad film, there's no two ways about it as far as I'm concerned.

But, this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been a lot better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What where they thinking?! Unlike the \"harmless\", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. In efforts to make his Bates seem innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay. Many of the other actors didn't seem to fit their parts either, including Julianne Moore who just didn't seem to fit in the film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the atrocious casting, the cinematography is notably shabby, despite the fact that they remade the film scene for scene. The one thing they added were random shots of object such as clouds or a nude woman, in between the shots of characters being murdered. These shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot in anyway, and in turn made no sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Psycho remake, which could been a decent picture, instead turned out to be a complete waste of time.</td>\n",

This is a big lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two supporting characters for example, turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be.

       "      <td>This Lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here the 40 something stay-at-home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away at college) is starting a new life after her divorce, helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal. She has even started up a friendship with her attractive, slightly younger perhaps, landscape architect / gardener (who's black). But then horror of middle-aged women's horrors, ANOTHER 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to, starts 'taking over\" her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener, and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee!! She runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! And backed up the toilet! And leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! And hangs her pieces of (African) artwork in the living room!! And so on. Well she may have killed the cat as well. Yeah, ok, the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough, but its more than a little ridiculous, especially as it turns into a campaign. The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. (So why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors, a much younger woman?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking, of course) 20 something. But there's this problem. Anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her POWER -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy, and escapes the consequences. (Well, there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. It just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. Of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things, and the 20 something has had help. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. Even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending, the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. Finally the 40 something's \"heroic\" battle back for THE HOUSE then begins. Woopie!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy TRO's (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. Indeed, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative), when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where that is true -- and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course that's not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic, and isn't taking her medicine. Even so it makes no sense. She isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband, though she does con his help (to the ex wife's fury) in her quest. She's after THE HOUSE (technically, to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). This second younger woman is after ALL THAT'S LEFT after the divorce, after affairs with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband!! (The ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn't matter, he still strayed!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protagonist is good enough looking for her age. But her outlook, attitude and focus is so small minded, frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her. Well, a core group of Lifetime fans care, I guess, judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. (I kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. I couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this flick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, here's a clue. The movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to \"listen to\" her 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover, and \"do whatever he says\" and \"let him take care of her\" (he means get her to keep taking her medicine) -- and then tricking him and returning to THE HOUSE. There she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something, who is taking a bath by candlelight, secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. There's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she had found. She then begins stroking her, mom like, and the two women have a bonding, female solidarity moment!!! How sweet.</td>\n",

I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories. I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc, but I fast became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet. I read (and still own) all of the Bantam books, I started going to comic book cons (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events) and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab 5. Philip Jose Farmer's Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase. In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat. It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up. The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story. These stories from the 30's were short and if one looked at Lester Dent's (AKA Kenneth Robeson) outline for writing them, they broke down into PERFECT 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment. One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm, it would have turned out better. The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there, but then fall short. It is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors (guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film) who all acquit themselves very well. Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the rest have fallen off the map sadly. I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero, but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful.

According to me, from different things. First of all, the movie's subject, the drug links up badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the movie. This one should have taken place in the sordid areas of Paris and should have gave birth to a dark and helpless climate,for example. Moreover, it's supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is softened and barely sketched out. Barbet Schroeder doesn't insist enough on the dramatic side of the story. You could have wished a little more of madness, cutting. On another hand, Schroeder doesn't succeed in gaining the audience's emotion and adherence in front of the two main characters' distress. You watch carelessly their trials with drug. Whereas the two main actors, they're perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the movie, especially Mimsy Farmer. At the end, you only retain the beauty of the mediterraneans landscapes bathed in sunlight. The film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969.

However, I was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig is comprised of several \"big rig\" drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but never do. At most, we get lost. We - the audience - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the storytelling, end up somewhere but without direction, location, or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intent on \"humanizing\" a group of people who they regard as \"overlooked\" and \"invisible\" comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. The problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. The directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. Overall, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long (should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of \"So what\" is never answered, and the entire film is one piece of see-through propaganda that does nothing to further \"enlighten\" (as the directors claim) the outside world about big riggers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Depardieu's most notorious film is this (1974)groundbreaker from Bertrand Blier. It features many highly sexual scenes verging on an X-rating, including one of Jeanne Moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her Jules and Jim menage a trois with the two hairy French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film; everything is fair game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's very odd that Americans tend to not like this film very much while many French people I've met consider it a classic. Something about it goes against what Americans have been programmed to 'like.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two bitch-slapping, hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities, going around molesting women and committing petty crimes. They're out for kicks and anti-capitalist, Euro-commie, slacker 'freedom.' Blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous. Best of all though, is the way the wonderful Stephane Grappelli score conveys the restless soul of the drifters, the deeper subconscious awareness or 'higher ideal' that motivates all the follies they engage in.</td>\n",

There's repetition of phrases -- \"my sweet little god daughter\" and minor variations of that line which comes to mind... and it's just sloppy soap opera dialog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, the music is so WRONG! Plus, the main bluesy \"theme\" is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this. And it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this theme never changes, even when the scene's emotional context does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequently, whenever it appears, it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music's corny, and it's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom -- a low budget 80's Canadian sitcom at that -- and this makes it feel as if we're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so miscast, there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only ONE type of NY accent -- a thick Bronx accent. I don't know if it's a question of the actors' limited capacity in only knowing *one* NY accent -- or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such an glaring anomaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it's the amateur script with it's leaden lines which makes this entire \"movie\"... blow.

The big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds, then clearly you have another think coming. The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no-holds-barred satirical farce. Instead, wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy, inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring half-measures every step of the way, tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality. Indeed, \"Over Her Dead Body\" is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it. Virtually every set-up, joke and sight gag in the film is flat-footed and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament. How else to explain the halfhearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past (that is particularly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and those studio execs sure have some 'splainin' to do.</td>\n",

       "0      My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.<br /><br />The trailer of \"Nasaan ka man\" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role. I have never been this touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. Imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema!! Way to go, Jericho and Claudine!!

       "1      Believe it or not, this was at one time the worst movie I had ever seen. Since that time, I have seen many more movies that are worse (how is it possible??) Therefore, to be fair, I had to give this movie a 2 out of 10.

       "2      After some internet surfing, I found the \"Homefront\" series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program \"Nightline\", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.<br /><br />To this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d√©cor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.<br /><br />As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a \"homefront\" either. Curiously, the first episode of the show \"Homefront\" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. That's like shooting the first episode of \"Gilligan's Island\" showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil \"whites\" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. We're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for \"Homefront\". The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical \"frightened / angry black family\". The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.<br /><br />In yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.<br /><br />Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 ¬ñ 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "3      One of the most unheralded great works of animation. Though it makes the most sophisticated use of the \"cut-out\" method of animation (a la \"South Park\"), the real talent behind \"Twice Upon a Time\" are the vocal characterizations, with Lorenzo Music's (Carlton from TV's \"Rhoda\") Woody Allen-ish Ralph-the-all-purpose-Animal being the centerpiece.

       "4      It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a hip, distant attitude could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon, never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. David Giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.<br /><br />Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films, especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky \"comments\" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them senseless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. <br /><br />In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent, and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie, and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit, to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye. <br /><br />As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters, poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "5      For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is \"Wow\". It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!

       "6      Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break'em for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's Brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant (\"Say goodnight to the bad guy\"). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it's a must-see. For the rest of you it's highly recommended. 10/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "7      Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was of course \"no question about it\" that I had to see this one. However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like \"extremely boring\" or \"nothing happened\" \"a complete waste of time\". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening. <br /><br />It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful, but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it. My god... I like my friends a lot but it's a pity that I can't share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. That thing, my friends, is beauty. As this film goes to show, beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced, intellectually shallow, consumer driven fast-food western societies. That doesn't mean however that I reject these fast-paced societies or that I look down on them (and neither does Kubrick) but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in. And what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming. <br /><br />When we go to this place it is possible to get a so called \"natural high\". It is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty. And never in my life has this \"natural high\" or \"spiritual orgasm\" as it is called by some or \"samaddhi\" by others been more intense. Yes it's more intense than a regular orgasm... several times more intense actually. Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right. Are they right? For me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe. In my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it: \"Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter the four-million year old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery.\" The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I experience when watching those gorgeous visuals. <br /><br />I can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast-food answers to big ontological questions. But instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers. The doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble, while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame. But this film shows us that when fast ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a \"thing in itself\" the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating, enchanting and maybe even comforting. We don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to let mystery be what it is, to embrace it even... we can finally bring our souls to rest. I am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed. Especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "8      I reached the end of this and I was almost shouting \"No, no, no, NO! It cannot end here! There are too many unanswered questions! The engagement of the dishwashers? Mona's disappearance? Helmer's comeuppance? The \"zombie\"? Was Little Brother saved by his father? And what about the head???????\" ARGH!! Then I read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and I have to say, I know it probably wouldn't be true to Lars von Trier's vision, but I would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned! Granted, it would be hard to find someone to play Helmer as the character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have yet to see a more self-absorbed, oblivious, self-righteous character on screen!

       "9      There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside.I love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about.Also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do.This is a movie that i enjoy watching highly, especially around Halloween time.John Carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film Halloween.Oh and if your thinking about watching the Rob Zombie remake don't.It is pure crap and a true Halloween fan would like the 1978 John Carpenter version better.Michael Myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film, and is a very well known one.So by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it.

       "10     Like almost everyone else, I became aware of this turkey on Mystery Science Theater 3000. It easily ranks as one of my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I really couldn't imagine attempting to watch this film on it's own though.........it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad.<br /><br />Miles O'Keeffe stars as Ator, a muscle-bound Fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men. We the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang-glider in about 5 minutes. Yeah, right! There's also a fairly attractive actress (can't remember her name) who wears a hub-cap as a chest shield. Oh, and I can't forget that wacky Asian side-kick Thong. He had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn't utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking.....and he failed miserably.<br /><br />The film isn't watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it's proper MST3K format. If you watch that version, you'll laugh yourself silly!<br /><br />\"I'm HUGE!!!!\"<br /><br />Rating:1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "11     Harvey Keital's best performance so far the new century. Very nicely photographed, a beautiful snap-shot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. It's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger, much more complex world that he doesn't yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor, the direction is crisp. Over all, a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this just makes the film a little less convincing. But if you can see beyond this, you will find a heartfelt trip to another world.

       "12     Bela Lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife. The midget in this film is hilarious!! A lot of freaks, plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless as you watch.<br /><br />Usually I'd score bore flicks like this one low, but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points.

       "13     OK this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked! The zombie make up was extremely fake! The acting is very poor! And it doesn't really follow the first one! While watching this I kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this. I would say catch it on TV, Don't spend your money on it! Its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list. I started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was pointless, I mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die. They made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying. If you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. The plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner. With these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give it a 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

nothing short of a bloody battle behind the convent walls.\"Flavia the Heretic\" is a well-directed and fairly notorious piece of Italian nunsploitation.The film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at times.The acting is great and the characters are well-developed.Overall,\"Flavia the Heretic\" is a genuinely moving and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and gore.You can't go wrong with it.8

       "15     Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a \"jollies\" project for Robert Redford, as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine.<br /><br />The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford's small-town boy David Chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, gets up the nose of, in no particular order, his coach, father and team-mates. Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel, I couldn't really be that excited for him one way or another.<br /><br />Of the actors, Redford, best profile forward, doesn't need to do much and indeed doesn't, while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material. Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way he's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.<br /><br />In truth though, there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don't fully compensate and you don't care a fig for any of the leading characters. One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "16     Well where do I begin my story?? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie.<br /><br />Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie. The Plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.<br /><br />The cast couldn't have been more plastic looking. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason. Very poor editing.<br /><br />All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money.

       "17     Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his \"idol's\" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it. Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It did make me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met up with Chris in Seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk. If anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.

       "18     This is a poor, poor movie. Full of clich√©s, unrealistic moments: punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out, never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions!!, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first, walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment!! Did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something!!? Anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke. It's a pity, because firefighters do an awesome job, and they deserve to have a good movie made about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.

       "19     The SF premise isn't unique (although it pretty much was back then), but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films. Especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture, that uses the SF premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don't have to lie to be unhelpful. Instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world.<br /><br />In part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. He knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how does he deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where nobody can understand him. The problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with. For me the film transports this hopelessness very well, with its dreary, artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world.<br /><br />Other than 'The Matrix' or 'The Thirteenth Floor' it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot, instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world.<br /><br />Arguably it is longer than it has to be (which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as I was) and part 2 runs pretty low on steam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "20     Pretty bad PRC cheapie which I rarely bother to watch over again, and it's no wonder -- it's slow and creaky and dull as a butter knife. Mad doctor George Zucco is at it again, turning a dimwitted farmhand in overalls (Glenn Strange) into a wolf-man. Unfortunately, the makeup is virtually non-existent, consisting only of a beard and dimestore fangs for the most part. If it were not for Zucco and Strange's presence, along with the cute Anne Nagel, this would be completely unwatchable. Strange, who would go on to play Frankenstein's monster for Unuiversal in two years, does a Lenny impression from \"Of Mice and Men\", it seems.<br /><br />*1/2 (of Four)

       "21     Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts off badly and just deteriorates. Katherine Heigl is woefully miscast in a Lolita role and Leo Grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character. The only cast-member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role. The script is dire, the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through! It is also the most sexist movie I have ever seen! Katherine Heigl's character is completely unsympathetic. She's seen as an evil, wanton seductress who lures the poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. It is implied throughout the movie that she's underage, and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief! At the end, she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously (ha!) become demented with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere. Horrible. Don't waste your time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "22     The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a \"Swedish\" film - the first being Susan Sontag's \"Brother Carl\" (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens' \"The Old Curiosity Shop\": \"One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell.\" Pretty much the same thing here. \"Interiors\" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. (\"I'm afraid of my anger.\" Looking into the middle distance: \"I don't like who I'm becoming.\") The directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. (\"I read a poem of yours the other day. It was in - I don't know - The New Yorker.\" \"Oh. That was an old poem. I reworked it.\") Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like Kenneth Branagh in \"Celebrity\").<br /><br />The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's \"Winter Light,\" the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. It all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.<br /><br />Allen's later \"serious\" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. I'll take \"Interiors.\" Woody's rarely made a funnier movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "23     Talk about being boring!<br /><br />I got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railroad. I expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />Spring and Chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. It's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as NOTGR which is something that I suggest you watch instead. Leave this bore alone. If you absolutely MUST see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Do not pay top dollar.

       "24     It is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it.<br /><br />At first I must tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:<br /><br />1) I quoted the tag line. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something special I never saw before.<br /><br />2) The \"flies\" in this movie look nothing like real flies. At least they could've make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With giant heads and slim torsos?<br /><br />3) The story. I guess it was written for 6 year old kids. I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.<br /><br />4) Excessive patriotism. For example: \"They are American files after all!\" Oh, give me a break.

       "25     A very interesting addition to the Scandavian surrealistic collection. Recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated. My interpretation of the 'strange' ending would be that Andreas' journey ends in Hell. He dislikes the bland consumer-led emptiness of purgatory; a sort of 'living' but not progressing, i.e. not getting anywhere - even the city's metro trains don't stop at the stations. It has a Metro system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually board those trains. He is unable to reach fragrant, sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination. The old Norse version of Hell (Hades, NOT Hell the terrestrial city) isn't burning hot like the British version, its cold, freezing, the land of Niflheim (land of cold and mists). This appears to be where Andreas end up, having just failed to access Heaven through that tunnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "26     The story of a woman (Ann) on her death bed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about her past. The flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young Ann is in the wedding of her friend Lila. At the wedding she meets Harris who will impact her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more \"responsible,\" a mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.<br /><br />First of all the good. The period detail in the movie is great. The dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. really put you in another time and place. And there is some very quality acting in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Lila's brother Buddy.<br /><br />Now for the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then... you are supposed to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her. And I thought the whole, \"he might be gay\" thing was out of the blue and didn't serve a purpose.<br /><br />Then we have Harris. The character acts wooden and creepy. Had this been another genre, you would have known that Harris was the serial killer from the get go. It is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so (but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out).<br /><br />And the grandest problem of all. Why don't Ann and Harris get together? They fall for each other. They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then...<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />They meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and I couldn't help but wondering why. WHY? The movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so I had a hard time feeling sorry for them.<br /><br />The part of the story in the present is fairly boring. The clich√© good daughter and the clich√© bad daughter. Nina changes over the course of the movie but I am not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a \"touching\" scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old Ann dreaming she's chasing a butterfly. It is really lame and embarrassing.<br /><br />\"There are no mistakes\", Ann advises at us. The statement doesn't ring true with the story. And it doesn't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "27     Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam war \"Jacknife\" came not too late or was even superfluous. It's one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war: The time after. Different from movies like \"Taxi driver\" or \"Rambo\" which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the Vietnam vets. Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship. \"Jacknife\" might be the quietest Vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified. Moreover, it can make us believe that the war has not finished, yet; at least for some of us.<br /><br />The three main characters are amazing. De Niro has done one of his best jobs but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. Possibly,this was his best performance ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "28     The film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from Something Weird Video in their \"Driver's Ed Scare Films Vol. 5\". For one thing the 1980 version is in color. SWV has on this disc an earlier version (1972) of the film made in b&w for WLWT television Channel 5 in Cincinnati. Either way this film is notorious. However, unlike most other driver's ed films, this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public. Thus the level of carnage has been ratcheted down. It's still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on Channel 5. If you're looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely American film phenomenon, \"The Last Prom\" is pretty typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. Whether it really affected any teenager's driving at all is anyone's guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "29     As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves, we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Broken in disc form. And yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentation.<br /><br />With regards to the latter, the only major flaw is that Broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer. Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio, demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected. Indeed, given Ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact.<br /><br />The same is also true of the soundtrack. Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mixes and whilst I'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the \"original\", the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior. Indeed, though the DD5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score, both are equally fine and free of technical flaws.<br /><br />As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries, loads of featurettes and various galleries. Indeed, given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary, there really is little to discuss. The 'Anatomy of a Stunt' featurette, for example, is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes for the rest of pieces. As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken's pre-production, production and post-production. And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of', in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view.<br /><br />Of the various pieces, then, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion. Then again, there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks. The one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously. Ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. And the technical ones are, well, extremely technical. Of course, we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs, but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome.

       "49970  I would rate this film high on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Ingrid's beauty aside, her talent is evident in scene after scene. She was sad, mean, witty,<br /><br />snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully funny, loving, tender, sorrowful, distressed, happy, etc. You name it, she was all those things and more. -And so<br /><br />convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who comes back to New<br /><br />Orleans and falls for a Texas gambler, Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing, just staring at each other. She, in an elegant white gown and he in a handsome white cowboy<br /><br />outfit, sitting there looking at her adoringly. What chemistry! What love!

       "49971  Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much I figured an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot. Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have seen this year. Don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely. The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together. So overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would pass on this one for now.

       "49972  I am always impressed when a director (and this case director/screenwriter) takes a piece of classical text - and makes it come alive. Sure, Shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with self-importance, but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so - by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe-inspiring. There are many troubling things about the play. It is a racist play about racism - and that still sticks. I have never accepted Jessica's desertion of her father without any acceptable reason. I have never accepted the Christians' position of sanctimonious self-righteousness. But, brilliantly, there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set, and mercifully, much of Jessica's part is cut.<br /><br />The text is quite stripped down with many passages cut. But, I only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when I expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. This economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie - not just a film of the play.<br /><br />And at last, there is a rationale as to why Antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserving/unrelated Bassanio - you can almost feel Antonio's pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of Bassanio passing by in a gondola, or arriving for a visit. But it is as subtle as that - no more. I was spellbound.<br /><br />There were many other highlights. I felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking. And, the suitors' trials are hilarious.<br /><br />Add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times, and you'll understand why I can't wait to see it again. And again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "49973  The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and \"idiot\" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama. There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point, and the implications put forth from religion early on (Sang, for example, is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil, push it up into another plane cinematically.<br /><br />That Thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that Park has displayed with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underrated I'm a Cyborg but That's OK, should be taken as a given. Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters, and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric, part romantic/erotic, part dramatic and lastly fantastical. And it doesn't always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set-up (though as a horror movie Park has more than his share of scary scenes). It's more akin to the movie Near Dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was, and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention, and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed. Once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds, you've seen em' all.<br /><br />Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor, much like Oldboy, only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being. An example of this can be found with the Priest's predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor. Or the manner in which Tae-Joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive, even as she's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood-suckers who've brought pain and horror to her home. But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together, of drama and existential pains, of a Bunuelian-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too), and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets. Not in a pornographic manner, but in the sense of these characters' release and escape, which doesn't last long over the scope of the story.<br /><br />If it's not as great as Oldboy, it's not something to carp about. Not all films Chanwook Park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and, at the least, he'll always be known as the man who directed that movie). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre, and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general. The film-making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and what a white room of 'daylight' the characters live in!), the humor is dark and hilarious, the acting is intense and moody- especially from subtle strokes from Song Kang-ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK-vin, and the ending, when it does finally get there, is one of those truly superb vampire-movie endings you'll be talking about for years, in a good way. In a battle between Thirst and Twilight, Thirst takes the knock-out in the first round. Between Let the Right One In or Near Dark, it's tougher to call. 9.5/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "49974  This movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all. However, I did not care for his mission to settle down, because I didn't care for his character. I don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class, or charisma. He should've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing, but to no avail. Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have any shame what-so-ever? Had he tidied up, and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring.<br /><br />Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. She could've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie.<br /><br />The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog. Now those two had chemistry! Academy nominations for both\n",

       "49975  The 221 episodes of \"The Lone Ranger\" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication. For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming. <br /><br />The new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 Sept-29 Dec 1949) and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain). These sets pretty much render \"The Legend of the Lone Ranger\" movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases. <br /><br />The early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice-over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments. <br /><br />The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started out Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to Lone Ranger status, his partnering with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the taming of his horse \"Silver\". <br /><br />There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil. While a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an Indian was distrusted, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil. One persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value. The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: \"who was that masked man?\". <br /><br />To really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be. If you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "49976  The Fallen Ones starts with archaeologist Matt Fletcher (Casper Van Dien) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant, now there's something you don't see everyday. Matt is working for property developer Morton (Robert Wagner) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist Angela (Kristen Miller) for reasons I'm unsure of. Anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing, Morton calls in security guy Ammon (Navid Negahban) to handle the situation. Meanwhile ancient text translator the Rabbi Eli Schmidtt (Tom Bosley) translates some ancient text (as he would) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the Fallen One, or something like that. It's up to Matt to save the day & the whole planet...<br /><br />Written & directed by Kevin VanHook, who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start, I personally thought The Fallen Ones was a terrible film & it's as simple & straight forward as that. There are so many things that are just plain bad about The Fallen Ones both on a technical & conceptual level, the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense & it doesn't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time I had almost lost the will to live. The character's are awful & as clich√©d as you like, the dialogue is bad as in very, very bad & the entire film is predictable, I mean it's not going to come as a surprise that Casper Van Dien is going to save the day is it? It's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state. This is bad, very bad. You have been warned.<br /><br />Director VanHook doesn't impress, the fight scenes are absolutely awful & why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple? They look naff. To give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant Mummy itself are actually good although there's not that many of them since he doesn't make an appearance for over an hour, there are also some normal sized Mummy's that look to have come straight from the set of The Mummy (1999), unfortunately these aren't used to any great effect & in fact are wasted as some comic relief. The mechanical Mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly & there is no way on Earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it, actually the more I think about the more ridiculous the idea is. Forget about any scares, tension or atmosphere & don't even think about any gore or violence because there isn't any.<br /><br />Technically The Fallen Ones isn't anything special & apart from the impressive giant Mummy effects there's little her to get excited about. The ghost CGI & water effects are terrible, it was made-for-TV & it's shows. The acting was poor, Wagner looks embarrassed & this is probably the only thing the likes of Dien & Bosley can get these days.<br /><br />The Fallen Ones is a bad film, there's no two ways about it as far as I'm concerned. Not recommended on any level or in any way, one to avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "49977  \"Protocol\" is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting Arab from an assassination attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity, and gets a new job working for the U.S. Government. Will the corridors of power in our nation's capital ever be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual even though \"Protocol\" isn't as funny as her best film \"Private Benjamin\". But it's still a good movie, and I did laugh alot.<br /><br />*** (out of four)

       "49978  *some possible spoilers*<br /><br />Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. But, this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been a lot better. <br /><br />First of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What where they thinking?! Unlike the \"harmless\", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. In efforts to make his Bates seem innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay. Many of the other actors didn't seem to fit their parts either, including Julianne Moore who just didn't seem to fit in the film. <br /><br />On top of the atrocious casting, the cinematography is notably shabby, despite the fact that they remade the film scene for scene. The one thing they added were random shots of object such as clouds or a nude woman, in between the shots of characters being murdered. These shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot in anyway, and in turn made no sense.<br /><br />Overall, this Psycho remake, which could been a decent picture, instead turned out to be a complete waste of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "49979  Zero Day is a film few people have gotten to see, and what a shame that is.<br /><br />When I saw the end, where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people, then commit suicide, and it made me grab my stomach. I was shaking, that's how strong this movie is.<br /><br />The movie is amazing. It's too incredible not to get a perfect ten. It's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. It is not a budget which makes a film good, it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good.<br /><br />It leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out. It makes you realise the true horror of shootings- especially if you were to know that person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people.<br /><br />I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it. I am fourteen, and I feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words. It feels like you're watching something that actually happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "49980  I have seen Shallow Grave years ago, and *that* was one of those movies I kept in memory for a very long time. It was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists. But all of these made sense.<br /><br />I can't tell the same about Dead Bodies. Above the title is a subtitle that claims it to be \"even better than Shallow Grave\". This is a big lie.<br /><br />Dead Bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the movie.<br /><br />Two supporting characters for example, turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be. That could work as a surprise, but it didn't surprise me. I could see it coming minutes before, and *that* is a big difference with Shallow Grave.<br /><br />Another thing I have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic. They behave like that more often when the movie gets to it's end.<br /><br />I would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent, not knowing what is going on. It would have been better for the contrast with for example Tommy and his friend who have to carry a *huge* secret with them.<br /><br />But no, for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides. It does not work in a movie like this.<br /><br />The end felt much like an open end. It left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I expected a whole lot more of it.<br /><br />At first I would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie. I liked watching it. Most of the time.<br /><br />But occasionally I saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end, I stick to four stars this time. And because it turned out to be a mistake that I have spend my time and money to it. Unlike Shallow Grave, I will probably forget Dead Bodies very soon. It is just not such a special movie.<br /><br />The makers could have done a far better job with this movie. It is a shame that they did not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "49981  This Lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity.<br /><br />Here the 40 something stay-at-home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away at college) is starting a new life after her divorce, helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal. She has even started up a friendship with her attractive, slightly younger perhaps, landscape architect / gardener (who's black). But then horror of middle-aged women's horrors, ANOTHER 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to, starts 'taking over\" her life.<br /><br />What this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener, and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee!! She runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! And backed up the toilet! And leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! And hangs her pieces of (African) artwork in the living room!! And so on. Well she may have killed the cat as well. Yeah, ok, the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough, but its more than a little ridiculous, especially as it turns into a campaign. The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. (So why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors, a much younger woman?)<br /><br />Supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking, of course) 20 something. But there's this problem. Anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her POWER -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy, and escapes the consequences. (Well, there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. It just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.)<br /><br />The premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. Of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things, and the 20 something has had help. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. Even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending, the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. Finally the 40 something's \"heroic\" battle back for THE HOUSE then begins. Woopie!!<br /><br />The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy TRO's (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. Indeed, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative), when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where that is true -- and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course that's not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime.<br /><br />The absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic, and isn't taking her medicine. Even so it makes no sense. She isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband, though she does con his help (to the ex wife's fury) in her quest. She's after THE HOUSE (technically, to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). This second younger woman is after ALL THAT'S LEFT after the divorce, after affairs with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband!! (The ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn't matter, he still strayed!!!)<br /><br />The protagonist is good enough looking for her age. But her outlook, attitude and focus is so small minded, frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her. Well, a core group of Lifetime fans care, I guess, judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. (I kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. I couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it.)<br /><br />** Spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this flick).<br /><br />Well, here's a clue. The movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to \"listen to\" her 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover, and \"do whatever he says\" and \"let him take care of her\" (he means get her to keep taking her medicine) -- and then tricking him and returning to THE HOUSE. There she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something, who is taking a bath by candlelight, secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. There's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she had found. She then begins stroking her, mom like, and the two women have a bonding, female solidarity moment!!! How sweet.   \n",
       "49982  Victor Buono as the Devil? Surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made. That's not the worst part of this silly mish-mash of sundry haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it. While the film is by no means terrible it doesn't even approach other 1970's \"haunted house\" flicks like Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. The Evil can be entertaining in spots, but don't expect to be scared. It's better approached as what it is: a silly horror film made all the sillier by it's over-serious approach.

       "49983  My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.<br /><br />I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK!!! This film is seriously underrated, and it shouldn't. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even stand up.<br /><br />My point: Parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they don't stare at them like they're aliens. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people, that people who might not seem \"normal\" are people too. 10/10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "49984  I like science-fiction movies and even, low-rated, made for TV, bargain bin, movies I may still find interesting. Well, I found this one in a bargain bin and brought it as a selection to a movie night with a group of friends.<br /><br />I was, literally, *emabrrassed* that I brought this movie.<br /><br />Right from the beginning, the acting is bad, the story is bland and the plot is almost non-existent. All this leads right to what the movie really was: A soft core porno graphical movie.<br /><br />The movie started with a woman prison where the prisoners are all sexy women working in some sort of mine. First clue that this movie is NOT serious: attractive women in a prison being forced to do physical labor. Yeah, right! Whatever. :P Once the \"plot\" continued, it was overshadowed by pointless scenes of people having sex. Halfway through the movie, my friends and I stopped watching, it was so stupid. The next day, I thought that I would give the movie another chance and watch the rest. I watched about another 15 minutes and gave up again.<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent, science-fiction or even a sci-fi monster movie DO NOT watch Lethal Target! If you want to see a low-budget, soft core porn that is light on plot, then see Lethal Target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "49985  oh well... its funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense,but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends,but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else.this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie,the suspense,the shock,and good characters. the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be,and he seemed to be the average angry \"D\" student able to outsmart only stupid people. and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called \"victims\"<br /><br />3/10 just expect this one in the daily funnies.

       "49986  I saw this film in its premier week in 1975. I was 13 years old and at that time I found it adequate and somewhat fun. I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories. I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc, but I fast became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet. I read (and still own) all of the Bantam books, I started going to comic book cons (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events) and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab 5. Philip Jose Farmer's Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase. In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat. It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up. The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story. These stories from the 30's were short and if one looked at Lester Dent's (AKA Kenneth Robeson) outline for writing them, they broke down into PERFECT 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment. One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm, it would have turned out better. The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there, but then fall short. It is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors (guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film) who all acquit themselves very well. Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the rest have fallen off the map sadly. I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero, but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful. I would say 0 but I give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction (Doc's answering machine at the end was a nice touch) and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "49987  A less-than-subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked, especially \"If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?\"<br /><br />Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some might disagree) of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the \"company line\" and condemns half the world to burn in Hell. To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas pageant.<br /><br />However, when the quartet \"update\" their play to parody Sister Mary's \"fallacious\" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events. The ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts.<br /><br />Not recommended. Go watch the play instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "49988  Wow...<br /><br />Reading through these comments, I see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the US and ... the Dutch! The US P.o.V. appears to be that this is quite a good little movie, Parker being a likable hero, the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality.<br /><br />All three Dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems. They categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster.<br /><br />Far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures, on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically. Still, based on factual observation - I saw the movie with my very own eyes - I suspect the Dutch are not too far off the mark: <br /><br />\"Parker Kane\" is poorly made, utterly boring, and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation.

       "49989  Like many other people, I've heard about \"more\" and I wanted to watch it due to the music that was composed by Pink Floyd. I must say that I was truly disappointed, not because of the music but the movie in itself. it's a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? According to me, from different things. First of all, the movie's subject, the drug links up badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the movie. This one should have taken place in the sordid areas of Paris and should have gave birth to a dark and helpless climate,for example. Moreover, it's supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is softened and barely sketched out. Barbet Schroeder doesn't insist enough on the dramatic side of the story. You could have wished a little more of madness, cutting. On another hand, Schroeder doesn't succeed in gaining the audience's emotion and adherence in front of the two main characters' distress. You watch carelessly their trials with drug. Whereas the two main actors, they're perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the movie, especially Mimsy Farmer. At the end, you only retain the beauty of the mediterraneans landscapes bathed in sunlight. The film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969. Nowadays, it <br /><br />seems dated. The hippy culture is nothing less than a faraway memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "49990  I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig is comprised of several \"big rig\" drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but never do. At most, we get lost. We - the audience - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the storytelling, end up somewhere but without direction, location, or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intent on \"humanizing\" a group of people who they regard as \"overlooked\" and \"invisible\" comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. The problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. The directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. Overall, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long (should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of \"So what\" is never answered, and the entire film is one piece of see-through propaganda that does nothing to further \"enlighten\" (as the directors claim) the outside world about big riggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "49991  I just can't get it, freaks out on the planet are talking about this one as a must seen, they even dare to call it a (s)exploitation because the possessed girl is seducing priests and is masturbating all time. Don't let me laugh. I watched the movie, seducing is only at the end of the movie and don't call it seducing,it's just bad language that's she is talking. And the masturbationscene is a big laugh too, she tries to seduce her father while masturbating, let me be clear, with her clothes on you perverts out there. It isn't gory or bloody at all, everybody is vomiting on Beyond The Door, well, let me tell, that one is for me better than this flick. Only the last 5 minutes the possessed one is vomiting and having weird eyes. If I had know that this is so bad then I would never caught me a copy. If you really wan't to see a (s)exploiation about exorcism watch Angel Above, The Devil Below or other cheesy ones. a waist of time this is.

       "49992  I was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off. How any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me. I know that the intent of the movie is to shock, but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive (holding back vomit as I type) - PLEASE! I shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby. I had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. No wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in HMV. I really have no desire to see any other movie by this Uwe person. Anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy.

       "49993  Depardieu's most notorious film is this (1974)groundbreaker from Bertrand Blier. It features many highly sexual scenes verging on an X-rating, including one of Jeanne Moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her Jules and Jim menage a trois with the two hairy French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film; everything is fair game.<br /><br />It's very odd that Americans tend to not like this film very much while many French people I've met consider it a classic. Something about it goes against what Americans have been programmed to 'like.'<br /><br />Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two bitch-slapping, hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities, going around molesting women and committing petty crimes. They're out for kicks and anti-capitalist, Euro-commie, slacker 'freedom.' Blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous.

       "49994  Years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie theaters's in between the actual features along with a Newsreel of current events, plus cartoons, especially on a Saturday afternoon. (The parents loved it mostly) \"The Return of Chandu\" was a 12 episode serial where Chandu,(Bela Lugosi),\"The Mysterious Mr. Wong\",'34 is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of Lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of Egypt,(Nadji)Maria Alba,\"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors\",'43. Princess Nadji is held captive by the black magic cult of Ubasti, who believe that she is a reincarnation of their long-dead goddess Ossana. These 12-episode serials take you way back in time and are very well produced, considering we are talking about 1934 !

       "49995  the people who came up with this are SICK AND TWISTED FREAKS how the hell can you exploit people like this? tricking people into thinking that this is real? which i probably don't doubt that it is... i saw this thing for the very first time today series 7 and it made me sick to my stomach i almost threw up. i just couldn't stop crying my eyes out for these poor people and if that woman really did have that baby you SHOULD ALL BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!!!!!!!!!! i have a 4 month old daughter and it is just absolutely appalling that would put a \"real\" pregnant woman in SO MUCH FRICKEN DANGER! you people are bloody ANIMALS and should be locked up for life allowing something like this to put on t.v. if this so called \"reallity show\" is for real then why isn't anyone being put in prison for allowing people to die and not doing a god damn thing about it.

       "49996  The script is so so laughable... this in turn, makes the actors' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed. There's repetition of phrases -- \"my sweet little god daughter\" and minor variations of that line which comes to mind... and it's just sloppy soap opera dialog.<br /><br />Worse yet, the music is so WRONG! Plus, the main bluesy \"theme\" is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this. And it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this theme never changes, even when the scene's emotional context does.<br /><br />Subsequently, whenever it appears, it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another.<br /><br />The music's corny, and it's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom -- a low budget 80's Canadian sitcom at that -- and this makes it feel as if we're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial.<br /><br />This is so miscast, there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only ONE type of NY accent -- a thick Bronx accent. I don't know if it's a question of the actors' limited capacity in only knowing *one* NY accent -- or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such an glaring anomaly.<br /><br />In the end, it's the amateur script with it's leaden lines which makes this entire \"movie\"... blow. When any foundation is shaky and unstable, it's impossible to build upon it without it's flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

The big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay.<br /><br />For if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds, then clearly you have another think coming. The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no-holds-barred satirical farce. Instead, wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy, inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring half-measures every step of the way, tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality. Indeed, \"Over Her Dead Body\" is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it. Virtually every set-up, joke and sight gag in the film is flat-footed and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament. How else to explain the halfhearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /><br />I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past (that is particularly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and those studio execs sure have some 'splainin' to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "49998  Your mind will not be satisfied by this no¬óbudget doomsday thriller; but, pray, who's will? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.<br /><br />Small _apocalyptically themed outing, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies. And it's not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid¬ónot only doomsday but convent creeps as well. The villain of the movie is a well¬óknown character actor.<br /><br />This wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of convent¬óexploitation, that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated. Anyway, the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; but the End of the World is not at all his pride!

       "49999  The chaser's war on everything is a weekly show from the guys that brought you CNNNN and the chaser decides where each week the 5 chasers and Firth break down the issues that we didn't know were important.<br /><br />This show goes beyond the mere satirizing of politics and television by not being afraid to take the mickey out of anyone whether it be a counter-girl at subway or even the prime-minister of Australia and although this may be familiar ground in say American television it has never been this well executed.<br /><br />The Chaser's war on everything is the smartest, funniest and overall most entertaining show on Australian television and if you haven't seen it you seriously owe it to yourself to give it a watch.

       "      <td>after some internet surfing i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffer com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990 s even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine to this show s credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d√©cor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously the first episode of the show homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended that s like shooting the first episode of gilligan s island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the show s namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940 s by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio near toledo however the show s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken jenkins is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of homefront david assael and james grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage</td>\n",

       "      <td>the great thing about thirst chanwook park s latest film is that it s the anti twilight some of you may take that as a minus but in reality it s a big plus park takes the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between sang hyeon and tae joo we see the conflicts of both of the characters sang hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unbeknownst to him turns him into a sickly but true blue vampire and tae joo with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by sang as in a very strong melodrama there s nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the implications put forth from religion early on sang for example is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism even as he just can t be that and knows it on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematically that thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that park has displayed with oldboy lady vengeance and the underrated i m a cyborg but that s ok should be taken as a given thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric part romantic erotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical and it doesn t always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set up though as a horror movie park has more than his share of scary scenes it s more akin to the movie near dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a person s existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds you ve seen em all thirst also has a wicked sense of humor much like oldboy only here with a bite pun intended meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being an example of this can be found with the priest s predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor or the manner in which tae joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as she s had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood suckers who ve brought pain and horror to her home but these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience what makes thirst last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a bunuelian surreal sense of catholicism i especially loved the dynamic between sang hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood sucking but really wants to be a vampire too and of the erotic the scenes where the priest finally gives in to tae joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters release and escape which doesn t last long over the scope of the story if it s not as great as oldboy it s not something to carp about not all films chanwook park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece and at the least he ll always be known as the man who directed that movie but thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general the film making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous and what a white room of daylight the characters live in the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody especially from subtle strokes from song kang ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from kim ok vin and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampire movie endings you ll be talking about for years in a good way in a battle between thirst and twilight thirst takes the knock out in the first round between let the right one in or near dark it s tougher to call 9 5 10</td>\n",

of a successful lawyer protagonist daughter away at college is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal she has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect gardener who s black but then horror of middle aged women s horrors another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts taking over her life what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that gasp really belonged to the divorcee she runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat and backed up the toilet and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator and hangs her pieces of african artwork in the living room and so on well she may have killed the cat as well yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane so why did she rent the room and to horror of horrors a much younger woman supposedly this increasingly arrogant natch younger woman has a mania for seizing control and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and erotically hot looking of course 20 something but there s this problem anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings it just isn t generally used in quite this sort of way the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her of course the 40 something doesn t know about these things and the 20 something has had help the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something you know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe is me of the sexy sweet young thing finally the 40 something s heroic battle back for the house then begins woopie the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro s or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so although they are generally only this easy against men they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true and it s a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller of course that s not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn t taking her medicine even so it makes no sense she isn t after the successful lawyer ex husband though she does con his help to the ex wife s fury in her quest she s after the house technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease this second younger woman is after all that s left after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband the ex husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling doesn t matter he still strayed the protagonist is good enough looking for her age but her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it s impossible to care about her well a core group of lifetime fans care i guess judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal i couldn t resist seeing just how far they d take it spoiler if such a thing is possible with this flick well here s a clue the movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her he means get her to keep taking her medicine and then tricking him and returning to the house there she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life there s a struggle and the 40 something mom wins by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti psychotic medicine she had found she then begins stroking her mom like and the two women have a bonding female solidarity moment how sweet</td>\n",

       "0      my family and i normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made they lack the depth and just not worth our time the trailer of nasaan ka man caught my attention my daughter in law s and daughter s so we took time out to watch it this afternoon the movie exceeded our expectations the cinematography was very good the story beautiful and the acting awesome jericho rosales was really very good so s claudine barretto the fact that i despised diether ocampo proves he was effective at his role i have never been this touched moved and affected by a local movie before imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie congratulations to star cinema way to go jericho and claudine

       "2      after some internet surfing i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffer com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990 s even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine to this show s credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d√©cor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously the first episode of the show homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended that s like shooting the first episode of gilligan s island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the show s namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940 s by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio near toledo however the show s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken jenkins is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of homefront david assael and james grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage

       "4      it was the sixties and anyone with long hair and a hip distant attitude could get money to make a movie that s how michael sarne director of this colossal flop was able to get the job sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie in fact the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film a terribly precious 60 s hip black and white featurette called joanna that film starred the similarly talentless actress waif genevieve waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat like twitter sarne who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon never mind a big budget hollywood film was in way over his head david giler s book is the best place to go to find out how the faux infant terrible sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone s eyes if there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era myra breckinridge provides that marker it embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea change in the body politic breckinridge is a touchstone of another equally important vein watch this movie and you ll get a different perspective on the less often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years many reviewers have spoken about the inter cutting of footage from other films especially older ones some actually liked these clunky comments on what was taking place in the movie others found them senseless annoying and obtrusive though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement in my opinion the real reason michael sarne put so many film clips into myra brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed that is to say sarne was so imagination challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time they weren t inspiration they were desperation his writing skills were nonexistent and david giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb so sarne was left to actually try and make a movie and he couldn t it was beyond his slim capabilities hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film s worth of clips the ghosts of writers and directors many long since passed on were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because sarne sure as heck wasn t able to this was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew not to mention the producers and the accountants cooled their heels and waited for something some great spark of imagination a hint of originality a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brow of zeus um oops no zeus no imagination no sparks millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips flying out the window bye bye as for myself i hated the film clips they denigrated sarne s many betters poked fun at people whose talents even those whose skills were not great far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration originality and even of plain competency compared to even the cheesiest of them

       "5      for my humanities quarter project for school i chose to do human trafficking after some research on the internet i found this dvd and ordered it i just finished watching it and i am still thinking about it all i can say is wow it is such a compelling story of a 12 year old vietnamese girl named holly and an american man named patric who tries to save her the ending leaves you breathless and although it s not a happily ever after ending it is very realistic it is amazing and i recommend it to anyone you really connect with holly and patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next

       "7      being a big fan of stanley kubrick s clockwork orange there was of course no question about it that i had to see this one however i put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like extremely boring or nothing happened a complete waste of time but when i saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith i was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001 a space odyssey there was no doubt in my mind that i was going to rent that movie the same evening it turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life of course watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it my god i like my friends a lot but it s a pity that i can t share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky that thing my friends is beauty as this film goes to show beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced intellectually shallow consumer driven fast food western societies that doesn t mean however that i reject these fast paced societies or that i look down on them and neither does kubrick but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in and what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming when we go to this place it is possible to get a so called natural high it is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty and never in my life has this natural high or spiritual orgasm as it is called by some or samaddhi by others been more intense yes it s more intense than a regular orgasm several times more intense actually many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right are they right for me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe in my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at jupiter the four million year old black monolith has remained completely inert its origin and purpose are still a total mystery the trance that bowman experiences is the same thing i experience when watching those gorgeous visuals i can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast food answers to big ontological questions but instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications that are contained in these answers the doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame but this film shows us that when fast ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt we can always rely on phenomena to make some sense out of the world from the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a thing in itself the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating enchanting and maybe even comforting we don t need an answer to what s really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives when we are able to let mystery be what it is to embrace it even we can finally bring our souls to rest i am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us

       "8      i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the dishwashers mona s disappearance helmer s comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldn t be true to lars von trier s vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more self absorbed oblivious self righteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in actors i just have to know how

       "9      there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly especially around halloween time john carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don t it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the 1978 john carpenter version better michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film and is a very well known one so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it

       "10     like almost everyone else i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater 3000 it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst3k episodes of all time i really couldn t imagine attempting to watch this film on it s own though it s really really really really really really really really really really bad miles o keeffe stars as ator a muscle bound fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang glider in about 5 minutes yeah right there s also a fairly attractive actress can t remember her name who wears a hub cap as a chest shield oh and i can t forget that wacky asian side kick thong he had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn t utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking and he failed miserably the film isn t watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it s proper mst3k format if you watch that version you ll laugh yourself silly i m huge rating 1

       "11     harvey keital s best performance so far the new century very nicely photographed a beautiful snap shot of pre castro cuba the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections it s really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger much more complex world that he doesn t yet understand the script is strong and filled with humor the direction is crisp over all a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync sound english rather than spanish probably to improve sales in the us unfortunately this just makes the film a little less convincing but if you can see beyond this you will find a heartfelt trip to another world recommended

padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare i loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical hollywood fashion the story never gets interesting and you feel helpless as you watch usually i d score bore flicks like this one low but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points

       "13     ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked the zombie make up was extremely fake the acting is very poor and it doesn t really follow the first one while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this i would say catch it on tv don t spend your money on it its not the worst movie i ve ever seen but its on the list i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again the plot was pointless i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived out of a 1 10 i give it a 2

       "15     rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a jollies project for robert redford as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine the story is as light as powdered snow with redford s small town boy david chappellet what kind of lead name is that who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and team mates women are a mere side show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above a free thinking independent woman played by camilla sparv the ski ing sequences are fine with some good stunt work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day plus i m not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel i couldn t really be that excited for him one way or another of the actors redford best profile forward doesn t need to do much and indeed doesn t while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material ms sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way he s doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way in truth though there s a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don t fully compensate and you don t care a fig for any of the leading characters one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it

       "16     well where do i begin my story i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie well i figured out within the first 20 minutes what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie the plot was crap and so was the script the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically the cast couldn t have been more plastic looking even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker like they dragged on for no particular reason very poor editing all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money boo

       "17     mark walhberg in a great role idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs imitating him to perfection and dressing like him when the opportunity comes for him to take over his idol s role in the band he jumps at the opportunity however the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be and relationships can change this movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads mark walhberg and jennifer aniston it did make me feel sad especially when emily jennifer aniston met up with chris in seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk if anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle although glamourous for a while is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want

       "18     this is a poor poor movie full of clich√©s unrealistic moments punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out never mind that someone s lost their home and possessions announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships the very dodgy cheesy music at the end the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke it s a pity because firefighters do an awesome job and they deserve to have a good movie made about what they do but not at the expense of common sense

       "19     the sf premise isn t unique although it pretty much was back then but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture that uses the sf premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don t have to lie to be unhelpful instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world in part two we follow the main character s struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation he knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses how does he deal with this knowledge he knows that there is a world that is more real than his but he is trapped in an artificial world a world where nobody can understand him the problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with for me the film transports this hopelessness very well with its dreary artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film s world other than the matrix or the thirteenth floor it s little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character s perception of the world arguably it is longer than it has to be which isn t a problem if you are as captivated by it as i was and part 2 runs pretty low on steam

       "21     absolutely one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time it starts off badly and just deteriorates katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character the only cast member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role the script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double decker bus through it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen katherine heigl s character is completely unsympathetic she s seen as an evil wanton seductress who lures the poor innocent married man to cheat on his wife it is implied throughout the movie that she s underage and the message that accompanies that plot strand just beggars belief at the end she isn t even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who s obviously ha become demented with rage and guilt but the script allows him to kill himself thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere horrible don t waste your time

       "22     the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a swedish film the first being susan sontag s brother carl which was made in sweden with swedish actors no less the results oscar wilde said it best in reference to dickens the old curiosity shop one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell pretty much the same thing here interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers i m afraid of my anger looking into the middle distance i don t like who i m becoming the directorial quotations to use a polite term from bergman are close to parody the incredibly self involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation i read a poem of yours the other day it was in i don t know the new yorker oh that was an old poem i reworked it far from not caring about these people however i found them quite hilarious much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen s earlier films only he s directed his actors to play the lines straight having not cast himself in the movie he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like kenneth branagh in celebrity the basic plot dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother seems to be lifted more or less from bergman s winter light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst it all comes through in the shopworn visual aural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the

       "23     talk about being boring i got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the galactic railroad i expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material boy was i wrong spring and chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation it s certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as notgr which is something that i suggest you watch instead leave this bore alone if you absolutely must see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap do not pay top dollar

       "24     it is pretty surreal what these flies can do eh well this is a cartoon so anything can happen in it at first i must tell you that i love animated movies unfortunately this year s repertoire is very weak this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws 1 i quoted the tag line it suggests that this movie has great 3d effects well i did not see any at least not something special i never saw before 2 the flies in this movie look nothing like real flies at least they could ve make them black but cyan flies seriously with giant heads and slim torsos 3 the story i guess it was written for 6 year old kids i could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified 4 excessive patriotism for example they are american files after all oh give me a break

that andreas journey ends in hell he dislikes the bland consumer led emptiness of purgatory a sort of living but not progressing i e not getting anywhere even the city s metro trains don t stop at the stations it has a metro system like you should be able to travel freedom escape but you can never actually board those trains he is unable to reach fragrant sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination the old norse version of hell hades not hell the terrestrial city isn t burning hot like the british version its cold freezing the land of niflheim land of cold

       "26     the story of a woman ann on her death bed her two daughters nina and constance and her thoughts about her past the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love her daughter constance is older more responsible a mother of two and has things together nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life first of all the good the period detail in the movie is great the dresses hair cars houses etc really put you in another time and place and there is some very quality acting in the movie vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young and she is an outstanding singer hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lila s brother buddy now for the bad which unfortunately is everything else things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great they have fun and dance then you are supposed to believe that she doesn t really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her and i thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and didn t serve a purpose then we have harris the character acts wooden and creepy had this been another genre you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out and the grandest problem of all why don t ann and harris get together they fall for each other they have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener s shack come home to find out about buddy s tragic end and then nothing they meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldn t help but wondering why why the movie doesn t let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for them the part of the story in the present is fairly boring the clich√© good daughter and the clich√© bad daughter nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why i m not sure what convinces her to change her life there is a touching scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old ann dreaming she s chasing a butterfly it is really lame and embarrassing there are no mistakes ann advises at us the statement doesn t ring true with the story and it doesn t ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn t wasted the talent of such good actors

       "27     even 15 years after the end of the vietnam war jacknife came not too late or was even superfluous it s one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war the time after different from movies like taxi driver or rambo which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the vietnam vets their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war the problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship jacknife might be the quietest vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified moreover it can make us believe that the war has not finished yet at least for some of us the three main characters are amazing de niro has done one of his best jobs but ed harris is the star of this movie possibly this was his best performance ever

       "29     as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldn t expect too much from broken in disc form and yet what s most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non anamorphic transfer otherwise we get the film in its original 1 85 1 ratio demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given ferrari s hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both dd2 0 and dd5 1 mixes and whilst i m uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the dd5 1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score both are equally fine and free of technical flaws as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you ll notice numerous commentaries loads of featurettes and various galleries indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the anatomy of a stunt featurette for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken s pre production production and post production and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall making of in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion then again there s also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn t take the film too seriously ferrari s pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some crossover with what s been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package

       "49971  okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year don t get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now

       "49972  i am always impressed when a director and this case director screenwriter takes a piece of classical text and makes it come alive sure shakespeare s text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with self importance but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe inspiring there are many troubling things about the play it is a racist play about racism and that still sticks i have never accepted jessica s desertion of her father without any acceptable reason i have never accepted the christians position of sanctimonious self righteousness but brilliantly there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set and mercifully much of jessica s part is cut the text is quite stripped down with many passages cut but i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it and it was replaced by a look that said it all this economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie not just a film of the play and at last there is a rationale as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserving unrelated bassanio you can almost feel antonio s pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of bassanio passing by in a gondola or arriving for a visit but it is as subtle as that no more i was spellbound there were many other highlights i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking and the suitors trials are hilarious add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times and you ll understand why i can t wait to see it again and again

       "49973  the great thing about thirst chanwook park s latest film is that it s the anti twilight some of you may take that as a minus but in reality it s a big plus park takes the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between sang hyeon and tae joo we see the conflicts of both of the characters sang hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unbeknownst to him turns him into a sickly but true blue vampire and tae joo with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by sang as in a very strong melodrama there s nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the implications put forth from religion early on sang for example is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism even as he just can t be that and knows it on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematically that thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that park has displayed with oldboy lady vengeance and the underrated i m a cyborg but that s ok should be taken as a given thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric part romantic erotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical and it doesn t always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set up though as a horror movie park has more than his share of scary scenes it s more akin to the movie near dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a person s existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds you ve seen em all thirst also has a wicked sense of humor much like oldboy only here with a bite pun intended meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being an example of this can be found with the priest s predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor or the manner in which tae joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as she s had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood suckers who ve brought pain and horror to her home but these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience what makes thirst last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a bunuelian surreal sense of catholicism i especially loved the dynamic between sang hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood sucking but really wants to be a vampire too and of the erotic the scenes where the priest finally gives in to tae joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters release and escape which doesn t last long over the scope of the story if it s not as great as oldboy it s not something to carp about not all films chanwook park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece and at the least he ll always be known as the man who directed that movie but thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general the film making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous and what a white room of daylight the characters live in the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody especially from subtle strokes from song kang ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from kim ok vin and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampire movie endings you ll be talking about for years in a good way in a battle between thirst and twilight thirst takes the knock out in the first round between let the right one in or near dark it s tougher to call 9 5 10

       "49974  this movie was supposed to have depicted a ladie s man bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all however i did not care for his mission to settle down because i didn t care for his character i don t understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him he had absolutely no class or charisma he should ve at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing but to no avail just because he is a musician does not make him sexy not to mention the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous does this man have any shame what so ever had he tidied up and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character but alas his character was bland and boring gina gershon s character was unnecessarily british she could ve just as easily been an uptight out of towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog now those two had chemistry academy

       "49975  the 221 episodes of the lone ranger were originally broadcast on abc from 1949 to 1957 and then for many years they played in local syndication for most of the original broadcast years the series was abc s most watched piece of programming the new dvd set from pop flix contains the first 16 episodes 15 sept 29 dec 1949 and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season for a total of 17 episodes the same 17 available on last year s mill creek entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain these sets pretty much render the legend of the lone ranger movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases the early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments the series itself was pure kiddie western with clear cut good and evil distinctions and no romance the title character played by clayton moore started out texas ranger john reid the first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to lone ranger status his partnering with the indian tonto jay silverheels and the taming of his horse silver there is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode the lone ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil while a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an indian was distrusted the lone ranger is feared by those who would do evil one persistent theme is that when the lone ranger and tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value the trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question who was that masked man to really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be if you don t take it seriously and keep wishing for some self reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated then again what do i know i m only a child

       "49976  the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher casper van dien in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant now there s something you don t see everyday matt is working for property developer morton robert wagner who wants to build a holiday resort on the land he calls in fellow archaeologist angela kristen miller for reasons i m unsure of anyway they both try to figure out what they ve got on they re hands when some of the team go missing morton calls in security guy ammon navid negahban to handle the situation meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt tom bosley translates some ancient text as he would is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up take over the world for the fallen one or something like that it s up to matt to save the day the whole planet written directed by kevin vanhook who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film it s as simple straight forward as that there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical conceptual level the script doesn t make a whole lot of sense it doesn t really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live the character s are awful as clich√©d as you like the dialogue is bad as in very very bad the entire film is predictable i mean it s not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it it s not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state this is bad very bad you have been warned director vanhook doesn t impress the fight scenes are absolutely awful why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple they look naff to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there s not that many of them since he doesn t make an appearance for over an hour there are also some normal sized mummy s that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy 1999 unfortunately these aren t used to any great effect in fact are wasted as some comic relief the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is forget about any scares tension or atmosphere don t even think about any gore or violence because there isn t any technically the fallen ones isn t anything special apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there s little her to get excited about the ghost cgi water effects are terrible it was made for tv it s shows the acting was poor wagner looks embarrassed this is probably the only thing the likes of dien bosley can get these days the fallen ones is a bad film there s no two ways about it as far as i m concerned not recommended on any level or in any way one to avoid

       "49978  some possible spoilers of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original remakes rarely are but this remake of one of hitchcock s greatest films psycho could have been a lot better first of all whoever cast the movie must have been psycho i mean vince vaughn as norman bates what where they thinking unlike the harmless almost childlike bates that anthony perkins was able to portray vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer in efforts to make his bates seem innocent vaughn ends up acting gay many of the other actors didn t seem to fit their parts either including julianne moore who just didn t seem to fit in the film on top of the atrocious casting the cinematography is notably shabby despite the fact that they remade the film scene for scene the one thing they added were random shots of object such as clouds or a nude woman in between the shots of characters being murdered these shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot in anyway and in turn made no sense overall this psycho remake which could been a decent picture instead turned out to be a complete waste of time

       "49979  zero day is a film few people have gotten to see and what a shame that is when i saw the end where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people then commit suicide and it made me grab my stomach i was shaking that s how strong this movie is the movie is amazing it s too incredible not to get a perfect ten it s sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film it is not a budget which makes a film good it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good it leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out it makes you realise the true horror of shootings especially if you were to know that person and this movie makes you feel like you know these people i recommend zero hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it i am fourteen and i feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words it feels like you re watching something that actually happened

       "49980  i have seen shallow grave years ago and that was one of those movies i kept in memory for a very long time it was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists but all of these made sense i can t tell the same about dead bodies above the title is a subtitle that claims it to be even better than shallow grave this is a big lie dead bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the movie two supporting characters for example turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be that could work as a surprise but it didn t surprise me i could see it coming minutes before and that is a big difference with shallow grave another thing i have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic they behave like that more often when the movie gets to it s end i would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent not knowing what is going on it would have been better for the contrast with for example tommy and his friend who have to carry a huge secret with them but no for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides it does not work in a movie like this the end felt much like an open end it left me with an unsatisfied feeling i expected a whole lot more of it at first i would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie i liked watching it most of the time but occasionally i saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end i stick to four stars this time and because it turned out to be a mistake that i have spend my time and money to it unlike shallow grave i will probably forget dead bodies very soon it is just not such a special movie the makers could have done a far better job with this movie it is a shame that they did not

       "49981  this lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon like absurdity here the 40 something stay at home ex wife of a successful lawyer protagonist daughter away at college is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal she has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect gardener who s black but then horror of middle aged women s horrors another 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts taking over her life what this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that gasp really belonged to the divorcee she runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat and backed up the toilet and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator and hangs her pieces of african artwork in the living room and so on well she may have killed the cat as well yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign the character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane so why did she rent the room and to horror of horrors a much younger woman supposedly this increasingly arrogant natch younger woman has a mania for seizing control and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and erotically hot looking of course 20 something but there s this problem anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings it just isn t generally used in quite this sort of way the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her of course the 40 something doesn t know about these things and the 20 something has had help the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something you know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe is me of the sexy sweet young thing finally the 40 something s heroic battle back for the house then begins woopie the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro s or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so although they are generally only this easy against men they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true and it s a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller of course that s not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn t taking her medicine even so it makes no sense she isn t after the successful lawyer ex husband though she does con his help to the ex wife s fury in her quest she s after the house technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease this second younger woman is after all that s left after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband the ex husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling doesn t matter he still strayed the protagonist is good enough looking for her age but her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it s impossible to care about her well a core group of lifetime fans care i guess judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal i couldn t resist seeing just how far they d take it spoiler if such a thing is possible with this flick well here s a clue the movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her he means get her to keep taking her medicine and then tricking him and returning to the house there she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life there s a struggle and the 40 something mom wins by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti psychotic medicine she had found she then begins stroking her mom like and the two women have a bonding female solidarity moment how sweet   \n",
       "49982  victor buono as the devil surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made that s not the worst part of this silly mish mash of sundry haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it while the film is by no means terrible it doesn t even approach other 1970 s haunted house flicks like amityville horror the changeling and the legend of hell house the evil can be entertaining in spots but don t expect to be scared it s better approached as what it is a silly horror film made all the sillier by it s over serious approach

       "49983  my older sister was born in march of 1985 and has cerebral palsy in her 22 years of life she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids i have been the butt of everyone s jokes because my sister is disabled and i still think to this day that nobody is or ever will give a damn about her and her condition then i saw this film i knew what christy s family was going through but they were lucky christy could talk he could communicate and he had artistic skills my sister can walk but she can t utter a word and she can t use her hands to do anything but grab onto things but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister and the ending to tell the truth made me cry and i ve seen shawshank this film is seriously underrated and it shouldn t this movie tells people something that people should be proud of their own lives thinking you can t write well this guy wrote with his foot thinking you re not attractive this guy got turned down by lots of girls because of his condition not the fastest runner christy couldn t even stand up my point parents of young children i suggest your children watch this movie with you so they ll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair they don t stare at them like they re aliens my sister got millions of stares and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people this film will teach people that people who might not seem normal are people too 10 10

       "49984  i like science fiction movies and even low rated made for tv bargain bin movies i may still find interesting well i found this one in a bargain bin and brought it as a selection to a movie night with a group of friends i was literally emabrrassed that i brought this movie right from the beginning the acting is bad the story is bland and the plot is almost non existent all this leads right to what the movie really was a soft core porno graphical movie the movie started with a woman prison where the prisoners are all sexy women working in some sort of mine first clue that this movie is not serious attractive women in a prison being forced to do physical labor yeah right whatever p once the plot continued it was overshadowed by pointless scenes of people having sex halfway through the movie my friends and i stopped watching it was so stupid the next day i thought that i would give the movie another chance and watch the rest i watched about another 15 minutes and gave up again if you are looking for a decent science fiction or even a sci fi monster movie do not watch lethal target if you want to see a low budget soft core porn that is light on plot then see lethal target

       "49985  oh well its funny should have been a sadistic comedy a lot of horror movies lack common sense but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation don t really expect hitchcock or anything close to this this is a good one for friends but i wouldn t recommend it for anything else this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie the suspense the shock and good characters the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be and he seemed to be the average angry d student able to outsmart only stupid people and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called victims 3 10 just expect this one in the daily funnies

       "49986  i saw this film in its premier week in 1975 i was 13 years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun i then came to discover the world of doc savage through the bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories i had no idea before any of this of the realm of doc but i fast became one of the most avid doc savage fans you could ever meet i read and still own all of the bantam books i started going to comic book cons along with star trek and doctor who and all manner of geeky fat kid events and had a wonderful time with each adventure i took with doc and the original fab 5 philip jose farmer s book the apocalyptic life of doc savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day i have very fond feelings regarding my doc phase in so saying i have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat it is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up the screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story these stories from the 30 s were short and if one looked at lester dent s aka kenneth robeson outline for writing them they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment one would have thought that with george pal and michael anderson at the helm it would have turned out better the spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there but then fall short it is interesting to watch though in that they hired second string character actors guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film who all acquit themselves very well paul gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and bill lucking is a television perennial all the rest have fallen off the map sadly i do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero but i fear i will not watch it much as it is too painful i would say 0 but i give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction doc s answering machine at the end was a nice touch and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun

       "49987  a less than subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show throughout the show dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked especially if god is so good why does he allow evil to exist in the world diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version though some might disagree of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the company line and condemns half the world to burn in hell to celebrate her school s 25th anniversary she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant however when the quartet update their play to parody sister mary s fallacious teachings the nun is pushed over the edge sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts not recommended go watch the play instead

       "49988  wow reading through these comments i see a remarkable socio cultural clash theme emerging between the us and the dutch the us p o v appears to be that this is quite a good little movie parker being a likable hero the story a light hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically still based on factual observation i saw the movie with my very own eyes i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark parker kane is poorly made utterly boring and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation

       "49989  like many other people i ve heard about more and i wanted to watch it due to the music that was composed by pink floyd i must say that i was truly disappointed not because of the music but the movie in itself it s a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm where does this disappointment come from according to me from different things first of all the movie s subject the drug links up badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the movie this one should have taken place in the sordid areas of paris and should have gave birth to a dark and helpless climate for example moreover it s supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is softened and barely sketched out barbet schroeder doesn t insist enough on the dramatic side of the story you could have wished a little more of madness cutting on another hand schroeder doesn t succeed in gaining the audience s emotion and adherence in front of the two main characters distress you watch carelessly their trials with drug whereas the two main actors they re perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the movie especially mimsy farmer at the end you only retain the beauty of the mediterraneans landscapes bathed in sunlight the film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969 nowadays it seems dated the hippy culture is nothing less than a faraway memory

       "49990  i was interested in the title and description of big rig while attending the sxsw film festival in austin tx however i was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as big rig ended big rig is comprised of several big rig drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the united states the characters are all wonderful people however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people instead the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide but never do at most we get lost we the audience end up going nowhere and like the direction of the storytelling end up somewhere but without direction location or plot why are we here where are we how did we get here the storytelling is sloppy and the directors intent on humanizing a group of people who they regard as overlooked and invisible comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending the problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers the directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions overall the story lacks any tension the film is entirely too long should have been a 15 min sketch the big question of so what is never answered and the entire film is one piece of see through propaganda that does nothing to further enlighten as the directors claim the outside world about big riggers

       "49992  i was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that i felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off how any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me i know that the intent of the movie is to shock but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive holding back vomit as i type please i shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby i had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point no wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in hmv i really have no desire to see any other movie by this uwe person

       "49993  depardieu s most notorious film is this 1974 groundbreaker from bertrand blier it features many highly sexual scenes verging on an x rating including one of jeanne moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her jules and jim menage a trois with the two hairy french hippies depardieu and deware there is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film everything is fair game it s very odd that americans tend to not like this film very much while many french people i ve met consider it a classic something about it goes against what americans have been programmed to like gerard and the late patrick deware are two bitch slapping hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities going around molesting women and committing petty crimes they re out for kicks and anti capitalist euro commie slacker freedom blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous best of all though is the way the wonderful stephane grappelli score conveys the restless soul of the drifters the deeper subconscious awareness or higher ideal that motivates all the follies they engage in

       "49996  the script is so so laughable this in turn makes the actors lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed there s repetition of phrases my sweet little god daughter and minor variations of that line which comes to mind and it s just sloppy soap opera dialog worse yet the music is so wrong plus the main bluesy theme is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this and it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation texture and arrangement of this theme never changes even when the scene s emotional context does subsequently whenever it appears it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another the music s corny and it s as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom a low budget 80 s canadian sitcom at that and this makes it feel as if we re always on the brink of throwing to a commercial this is so miscast there s a lot of overacting and it s a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only one type of ny accent a thick bronx accent i don t know if it s a question of the actors limited capacity in only knowing one ny accent or whether it s a question of the director s ability to notice such an glaring anomaly in the end it s the amateur script with it s leaden lines which makes this entire movie blow when any foundation is shaky and unstable it s impossible to build upon it without it s flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways

       "49997  so there s this bride you see and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding then get this a year later her former fianc√© falls in love with a beautiful psychic and then that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriend he he it ll be hilarious polite chuckling this i like to envision is how jeff lowell the man who dreamed up over her dead body presented his concept to the studio execs over there at new line cinema the big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project allowing lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay for if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds then clearly you have another think coming the only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no holds barred satirical farce instead wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy lowell engages in boring half measures every step of the way tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality indeed over her dead body is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it s hard to know where exactly lowell thought he was going with it virtually every set up joke and sight gag in the film is flat footed and poorly executed with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament how else to explain the halfhearted lifeless performances of paul rudd eva langoria parker lake bell and jason biggs in their various roles i choose not to blame the actors some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past that is particularly the case with rudd but lowell and those studio execs sure have some splainin to do
